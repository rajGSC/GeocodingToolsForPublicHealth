Geocoding Tools for Public Health.
-------

This was developed as a presentation to the NCEPH Public Health Surveillance short course in March 2012.

I've made subsequent improvements to this code, but it is still in development.  The issue is the handling of multiple hits and dealing with false positives.  THis is hard coded to take the first match that google returns.  I've fixed it to give you a clerical review step for all multiple hit addresses.  In the near future I'll share that too.
